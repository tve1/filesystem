Indeed, they had quite\"settled among themselves that she never was to be married, and they\"called her the old maid. Accordingly, when I mentioned it, with the\"greatest precaution, to Mrs. Crewler--\'\"\"\'The mama?\' said I.\"\"\'The mama,\' said Traddles--\'Reverend Horace Crewler--when I mentioned it\"with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler, the effect upon her was\"such that she gave a scream and became insensible.

As to\"myself, Copperfield, I give you my word, I felt a perfect bird of prey\"towards the family.\'\"\"\'The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?\'\"\"\'Why, I can\'t say they did,\' he returned. \'When we had comparatively\"reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You\"recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter\"with her spine?\'\"\"\'Perfectly!\'\"\"\'She clenched both her hands,\' said Traddles, looking at me in dismay;\"\'shut her eyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; and\"took nothing for two days but toast-and-water, administered with a\"tea-spoon.\'\"\"\'What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!\' I remarked.\"\"\'Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield!\' said Traddles. \'She is a very\"charming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling. In fact, they all\"have. Sophy told me afterwards, that the self-reproach she underwent\"while she was in attendance upon Sarah, no words could describe. I know\"it must have been severe, by my own feelings, Copperfield; which were\"like a criminal\'s. After Sarah was restored, we still had to break it\"to the other eight; and it produced various effects upon them of a most\"pathetic nature. The two little ones, whom Sophy educates, have only\"just left off de-testing me.\'\"\"\'At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?\' said I.\"\"\'Ye-yes, I should say they were, on the whole, resigned to it,\' said\"Traddles, doubtfully. \'The fact is, we avoid mentioning the subject;\"and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great\"consolation to them. There will be a deplorable scene, whenever we\"are married. It will be much more like a funeral, than a wedding.

On our approaching the house where the Misses Spenlow lived,\"I was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of\"mind, that Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass\"of ale. This having been administered at a neighbouring public-house, he\"conducted me, with tottering steps, to the Misses Spenlow\'s door.\"\"I had a vague sensation of being, as it were, on view, when the maid\"opened it; and of wavering, somehow, across a hall with a weather-glass\"in it, into a quiet little drawing-room on the ground-floor, commanding\"a neat garden. Also of sitting down here, on a sofa, and seeing\"Traddles\'s hair start up, now his hat was removed, like one of those\"obtrusive little figures made of springs, that fly out of fictitious\"snuff-boxes when the lid is taken off. Also of hearing an old-fashioned\"clock ticking away on the chimney-piece, and trying to make it keep time\"to the jerking of my heart,--which it wouldn\'t. Also of looking round\"the room for any sign of Dora, and seeing none. Also of thinking that\"Jip once barked in the distance, and was instantly choked by somebody.\"Ultimately I found myself backing Traddles into the fireplace, and\"bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies, dressed in\"black, and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of\"the late Mr. Spenlow.\"\"\'Pray,\' said one of the two little ladies, \'be seated.\'\"\"When I had done tumbling over Traddles, and had sat upon something which\"was not a cat--my first seat was--I so far recovered my sight, as to\"perceive that Mr. Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the\"family; that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the\"two sisters; and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the\"conference, inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand--so familiar as\"it looked to me, and yet so odd!--and was referring to it through an\"eye-glass. They were dressed alike, but this sister wore her dress with\"a more youthful air than the other; and perhaps had a trifle more frill,\"or tucker, or brooch, or bracelet, or some little thing of that kind,\"which made her look more lively. They were both upright in their\"carriage, formal, precise, composed, and quiet. The sister who had\"not my letter, had her arms crossed on her breast, and resting on each\"other, like an Idol.\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield, I believe,\' said the sister who had got my letter,\"addressing herself to Traddles.\"\"This was a frightful beginning. Traddles had to indicate that I was Mr.\"Copperfield, and I had to lay claim to myself, and they had to divest\"themselves of a preconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield,\"and altogether we were in a nice condition. To improve it, we all\"distinctly heard Jip give two short barks, and receive another choke.\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield!\' said the sister with the letter.\"\"I did something--bowed, I suppose--and was all attention, when the other\"sister struck in.\"\"\'My sister Lavinia,\' said she \'being conversant with matters of this\"nature, will state what we consider most calculated to promote the\"happiness of both parties.\'\"\"I discovered afterwards that Miss Lavinia was an authority in affairs\"of the heart, by reason of there having anciently existed a certain Mr.\"Pidger, who played short whist, and was supposed to have been enamoured\"of her. My private opinion is, that this was entirely a gratuitous\"assumption, and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such\"sentiments--to which he had never given any sort of expression that\"I could ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had a\"superstition, however, that he would have declared his passion, if he\"had not been cut short in his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking\"his constitution, and over-doing an attempt to set it right again by\"swilling Bath water. They had a lurking suspicion even, that he died of\"secret love; though I must say there was a picture of him in the house\"with a damask nose, which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed\"upon.\"\"\'We will not,\' said Miss Lavinia, \'enter on the past history of this\"matter. Our poor brother Francis\'s death has cancelled that.\'\"\"\'We had not,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'been in the habit of frequent\"association with our brother Francis; but there was no decided division\"or disunion between us. Francis took his road; we took ours. We\"considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should\"be so. And it was so.\'\"\"Each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak, shook her head\"after speaking, and became upright again when silent. Miss Clarissa\"never moved her arms. She sometimes played tunes upon them with her\"fingers--minuets and marches I should think--but never moved them.\"\"\'Our niece\'s position, or supposed position, is much changed by our\"brother Francis\'s death,\' said Miss Lavinia; \'and therefore we consider\"our brother\'s opinions as regarded her position as being changed too. We\"have no reason to doubt, Mr. Copperfield, that you are a young gentleman\"possessed of good qualities and honourable character; or that you have\"an affection--or are fully persuaded that you have an affection--for our\"niece.\'\"\"I replied, as I usually did whenever I had a chance, that nobody had\"ever loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles came to my assistance\"with a confirmatory murmur.\"\"Miss Lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder, when Miss Clarissa,\"who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother\"Francis, struck in again:\"\"\'If Dora\'s mama,\' she said, \'when she married our brother Francis, had\"at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner-table,\"it would have been better for the happiness of all parties.\'\"\"\'Sister Clarissa,\' said Miss Lavinia. \'Perhaps we needn\'t mind that\"now.\'\"\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'it belongs to the subject. With\"your branch of the subject, on which alone you are competent to speak, I\"should not think of interfering. On this branch of the subject I have a\"voice and an opinion. It would have been better for the happiness of\"all parties, if Dora\'s mama, when she married our brother Francis, had\"mentioned plainly what her intentions were. We should then have known\"what we had to expect. We should have said \"Pray do not invite us,\"at any time\"; and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been\"avoided.\'\"\"When Miss Clarissa had shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed: again\"referring to my letter through her eye-glass. They both had little\"bright round twinkling eyes, by the way, which were like birds\' eyes.\"They were not unlike birds, altogether; having a sharp, brisk, sudden\"manner, and a little short, spruce way of adjusting themselves, like\"canaries.\"\"Miss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed:\"\"\'You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield,\"to visit here, as the accepted suitor of our niece.\'\"\"\'If our brother Francis,\' said Miss Clarissa, breaking out again, if I\"may call anything so calm a breaking out, \'wished to surround himself\"with an atmosphere of Doctors\' Commons, and of Doctors\' Commons only,\"what right or desire had we to object? None, I am sure. We have ever\"been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone. But why not say\"so? Let our brother Francis and his wife have their society. Let\"my sister Lavinia and myself have our society. We can find it for\"ourselves, I hope.\'\"\"As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me, both Traddles and\"I made some sort of reply. Traddles was inaudible. I think I observed,\"myself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned. I don\'t in the\"least know what I meant.\"\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, having now relieved her mind, \'you\"can go on, my dear.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia proceeded:\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful\"indeed in considering this letter; and we have not considered it without\"finally showing it to our niece, and discussing it with our niece. We\"have no doubt that you think you like her very much.\'\"\"\'Think, ma\'am,\' I rapturously began, \'oh!--\'\"\"But Miss Clarissa giving me a look (just like a sharp canary), as\"requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle, I begged pardon.\"\"\'Affection,\' said Miss Lavinia, glancing at her sister for\"corroboration, which she gave in the form of a little nod to every\"clause, \'mature affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express\"itself. Its voice is low. It is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush,\"waits and waits. Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away,\"and finds it still ripening in the shade.\'\"\"Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her\"supposed experience of the stricken Pidger; but I saw, from the gravity\"with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached\"to these words.\"\"\'The light--for I call them, in comparison with such sentiments, the\"light--inclinations of very young people,\' pursued Miss Lavinia, \'are\"dust, compared to rocks. It is owing to the difficulty of knowing\"whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation, that\"my sister Clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act, Mr.\"Copperfield, and Mr.--\'\"\"\'Traddles,\' said my friend, finding himself looked at.\"\"\'I beg pardon. Of the Inner Temple, I believe?\' said Miss Clarissa,\"again glancing at my letter.\"\"Traddles said \'Exactly so,\' and became pretty red in the face.\"\"Now, although I had not received any express encouragement as yet, I\"fancied that I saw in the two little sisters, and particularly in Miss\"Lavinia, an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of\"domestic interest, a settling down to make the most of it, a disposition\"to pet it, in which there was a good bright ray of hope. I thought\"I perceived that Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in\"superintending two young lovers, like Dora and me; and that Miss\"Clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend\"us, and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject\"whenever that impulse was strong upon her. This gave me courage to\"protest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell, or\"anyone believe; that all my friends knew how I loved her; that my aunt,\"Agnes, Traddles, everyone who knew me, knew how I loved her, and how\"earnest my love had made me. For the truth of this, I appealed to\"Traddles. And Traddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a\"Parliamentary Debate, really did come out nobly: confirming me in good\"round terms, and in a plain sensible practical manner, that evidently\"made a favourable impression.\"\"\'I speak, if I may presume to say so, as one who has some little\"experience of such things,\' said Traddles, \'being myself engaged to a\"young lady--one of ten, down in Devonshire--and seeing no probability,\"at present, of our engagement coming to a termination.\'\"\"\'You may be able to confirm what I have said, Mr. Traddles,\' observed\"Miss Lavinia, evidently taking a new interest in him, \'of the affection\"that is modest and retiring; that waits and waits?\'\"\"\'Entirely, ma\'am,\' said Traddles.\"\"Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia, and shook her head gravely. Miss\"Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh.\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'take my smelling-bottle.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic\"vinegar--Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while; and\"then went on to say, rather faintly:\"\"\'My sister and myself have been in great doubt, Mr. Traddles, what\"course we ought to take in reference to the likings, or imaginary\"likings, of such very young people as your friend Mr. Copperfield and\"our niece.\'\"\"\'Our brother Francis\'s child,\' remarked Miss Clarissa. \'If our brother\"Francis\'s wife had found it convenient in her lifetime (though she had\"an unquestionable right to act as she thought best) to invite the family\"to her dinner-table, we might have known our brother Francis\'s child\"better at the present moment. Sister Lavinia, proceed.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia turned my letter, so as to bring the superscription towards\"herself, and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking\"notes she had made on that part of it.\"\"\'It seems to us,\' said she, \'prudent, Mr. Traddles, to bring these\"feelings to the test of our own observation. At present we know nothing\"of them, and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there\"may be in them. Therefore we are inclined so far to accede to Mr.\"Copperfield\'s proposal, as to admit his visits here.\'\"\"\'I shall never, dear ladies,\' I exclaimed, relieved of an immense load\"of apprehension, \'forget your kindness!\'\"\"\'But,\' pursued Miss Lavinia,--\'but, we would prefer to regard those\"visits, Mr. Traddles, as made, at present, to us. We must guard\"ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between Mr.\"Copperfield and our niece, until we have had an opportunity--\'\"\"\'Until YOU have had an opportunity, sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa.\"\"\'Be it so,\' assented Miss Lavinia, with a sigh--\'until I have had an\"opportunity of observing them.\'\"\"\'Copperfield,\' said Traddles, turning to me, \'you feel, I am sure, that\"nothing could be more reasonable or considerate.\'\"\"\'Nothing!\' cried I. \'I am deeply sensible of it.\'\"\"\'In this position of affairs,\' said Miss Lavinia, again referring to\"her notes, \'and admitting his visits on this understanding only, we\"must require from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assurance, on his word of\"honour, that no communication of any kind shall take place between him\"and our niece without our knowledge. That no project whatever shall be\"entertained with regard to our niece, without being first submitted to\"us--\' \'To you, sister Lavinia,\' Miss Clarissa interposed.\"\"\'Be it so, Clarissa!\' assented Miss Lavinia resignedly--\'to me--and\"receiving our concurrence. We must make this a most express and serious\"stipulation, not to be broken on any account. We wished Mr. Copperfield\"to be accompanied by some confidential friend today,\' with an\"inclination of her head towards Traddles, who bowed, \'in order that\"there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject. If Mr.\"Copperfield, or if you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving\"this promise, I beg you to take time to consider it.\'\"\"I exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervour, that not a moment\'s\"consideration could be necessary. I bound myself by the required\"promise, in a most impassioned manner; called upon Traddles to witness\"it; and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if I ever\"swerved from it in the least degree.\"\"\'Stay!\' said Miss Lavinia, ho see, Sophy being of so much use in the family, none of them could\"endure the thought of her ever being married. Indeed, they had quite\"settled among themselves that she never was to be married, and they\"called her the old maid.

I couldn\'t approach\"the subject again, for months.\'\"\"\'You did at last?\' said I.\"\"\'Well, the Reverend Horace did,\' said Traddles. \'He is an excellent man,\"most exemplary in every way; and he pointed out to her that she ought,\"as a Christian, to reconcile herself to the sacrifice (especially as it\"was so uncertain), and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me. As to\"myself, Copperfield, I give you my word, I felt a perfect bird of prey\"towards the family.\'\"\"\'The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?\'\"\"\'Why, I can\'t say they did,\' he returned. \'When we had comparatively\"reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You\"recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter\"with her spine?\'\"\"\'Perfectly!\'\"\"\'She clenched both her hands,\' said Traddles, looking at me in dismay;\"\'shut her eyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; and\"took nothing for two days but toast-and-water, administered with a\"tea-spoon.\'\"\"\'What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!\' I remarked.\"\"\'Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield!\' said Traddles. \'She is a very\"charming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling.

And Traddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a\"Parliamentary Debate, really did come out nobly: confirming me in good\"round terms, and in a plain sensible practical manner, that evidently\"made a favourable impression.\"\"\'I speak, if I may presume to say so, as one who has some little\"experience of such things,\' said Traddles, \'being myself engaged to a\"young lady--one of ten, down in Devonshire--and seeing no probability,\"at present, of our engagement coming to a termination.\'\"\"\'You may be able to confirm what I have said, Mr. Traddles,\' observed\"Miss Lavinia, evidently taking a new interest in him, \'of the affection\"that is modest and retiring; that waits and waits?\'\"\"\'Entirely, ma\'am,\' said Traddles.\"\"Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia, and shook her head gravely. Miss\"Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh.\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'take my smelling-bottle.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic\"vinegar--Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while; and\"then went on to say, rather faintly:\"\"\'My sister and myself have been in great doubt, Mr. Traddles, what\"course we ought to take in reference to the likings, or imaginary\"likings, of such very young people as your friend Mr. Copperfield and\"our niece.\'\"\"\'Our brother Francis\'s child,\' remarked Miss Clarissa. \'If our brother\"Francis\'s wife had found it convenient in her lifetime (though she had\"an unquestionable right to act as she thought best) to invite the family\"to her dinner-table, we might have known our brother Francis\'s child\"better at the present moment. Sister Lavinia, proceed.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia turned my letter, so as to bring the superscription towards\"herself, and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking\"notes she had made on that part of it.\"\"\'It seems to us,\' said she, \'prudent, Mr. Traddles, to bring these\"feelings to the test of our own observation. At present we know nothing\"of them, and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there\"may be in them. Therefore we are inclined so far to accede to Mr.\"Copperfield\'s proposal, as to admit his visits here.\'\"\"\'I shall never, dear ladies,\' I exclaimed, relieved of an immense load\"of apprehension, \'forget your kindness!\'\"\"\'But,\' pursued Miss Lavinia,--\'but, we would prefer to regard those\"visits, Mr. Traddles, as made, at present, to us. We must guard\"ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between Mr.\"Copperfield and our niece, until we have had an opportunity--\'\"\"\'Until YOU have had an opportunity, sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa.\"\"\'Be it so,\' assented Miss Lavinia, with a sigh--\'until I have had an\"opportunity of observing them.\'\"\"\'Copperfield,\' said Traddles, turning to me, \'you feel, I am sure, that\"nothing could be more reasonable or considerate.\'\"\"\'Nothing!\' cried I. \'I am deeply sensible of it.\'\"\"\'In this position of affairs,\' said Miss Lavinia, again referring to\"her notes, \'and admitting his visits on this understanding only, we\"must require from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assurance, on his word of\"honour, that no communication of any kind shall take place between him\"and our niece without our knowledge. That no project whatever shall be\"entertained with regard to our niece, without being first submitted to\"us--\' \'To you, sister Lavinia,\' Miss Clarissa interposed.\"\"\'Be it so, Clarissa!\' assented Miss Lavinia resignedly--\'to me--and\"receiving our concurrence. We must make this a most express and serious\"stipulation, not to be broken on any account. We wished Mr. Copperfield\"to be accompanied by some confidential friend today,\' with an\"inclination of her head towards Traddles, who bowed, \'in order that\"there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject. If Mr.\"Copperfield, or if you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving\"this promise, I beg you to take time to consider it.\'\"\"I exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervour, that not a moment\'s\"consideration could be necessary. I bound myself by the required\"promise, in a most impassioned manner; called upon Traddles to witness\"it; and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if I ever\"swerved from it in the least degree.\"\"\'Stay!\' said Miss Lavinia, ho see, Sophy being of so much use in the family, none of them could\"endure the thought of her ever being married. Indeed, they had quite\"settled among themselves that she never was to be married, and they\"called her the old maid. Accordingly, when I mentioned it, with the\"greatest precaution, to Mrs. Crewler--\'\"\"\'The mama?\' said I.\"\"\'The mama,\' said Traddles--\'Reverend Horace Crewler--when I mentioned it\"with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler, the effect upon her was\"such that she gave a scream and became insensible. I couldn\'t approach\"the subject again, for months.\'\"\"\'You did at last?\' said I.\"\"\'Well, the Reverend Horace did,\' said Traddles. \'He is an excellent man,\"most exemplary in every way; and he pointed out to her that she ought,\"as a Christian, to reconcile herself to the sacrifice (especially as it\"was so uncertain), and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me. As to\"myself, Copperfield, I give you my word, I felt a perfect bird of prey\"towards the family.\'\"\"\'The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?\'\"\"\'Why, I can\'t say they did,\' he returned. \'When we had comparatively\"reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You\"recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter\"with her spine?\'\"\"\'Perfectly!\'\"\"\'She clenched both her hands,\' said Traddles, looking at me in dismay;\"\'shut her eyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; and\"took nothing for two days but toast-and-water, administered with a\"tea-spoon.\'\"\"\'What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!\' I remarked.\"\"\'Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield!\' said Traddles. \'She is a very\"charming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling. In fact, they all\"have. Sophy told me afterwards, that the self-reproach she underwent\"while she was in attendance upon Sarah, no words could describe. I know\"it must have been severe, by my own feelings, Copperfield; which were\"like a criminal\'s. After Sarah was restored, we still had to break it\"to the other eight; and it produced various effects upon them of a most\"pathetic nature. The two little ones, whom Sophy educates, have only\"just left off de-testing me.\'\"\"\'At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?\' said I.\"\"\'Ye-yes, I should say they were, on the whole, resigned to it,\' said\"Traddles, doubtfully. \'The fact is, we avoid mentioning the subject;\"and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great\"consolation to them. There will be a deplorable scene, whenever we\"are married. It will be much more like a funeral, than a wedding. And\"they\'ll all hate me for taking her away!\'\"\"His honest face, as he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his\"head, impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality,\"for I was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation\"and wandering of mind, as to be quite unable to fix my attention on\"anything. On our approaching the house where the Misses Spenlow lived,\"I was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of\"mind, that Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass\"of ale. This having been administered at a neighbouring public-house, he\"conducted me, with tottering steps, to the Misses Spenlow\'s door.\"\"I had a vague sensation of being, as it were, on view, when the maid\"opened it; and of wavering, somehow, across a hall with a weather-glass\"in it, into a quiet little drawing-room on the ground-floor, commanding\"a neat garden. Also of sitting down here, on a sofa, and seeing\"Traddles\'s hair start up, now his hat was removed, like one of those\"obtrusive little figures made of springs, that fly out of fictitious\"snuff-boxes when the lid is taken off. Also of hearing an old-fashioned\"clock ticking away on the chimney-piece, and trying to make it keep time\"to the jerking of my heart,--which it wouldn\'t. Also of looking round\"the room for any sign of Dora, and seeing none. Also of thinking that\"Jip once barked in the distance, and was instantly choked by somebody.\"Ultimately I found myself backing Traddles into the fireplace, and\"bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies, dressed in\"black, and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of\"the late Mr. Spenlow.\"\"\'Pray,\' said one of the two little ladies, \'be seated.\'\"\"When I had done tumbling over Traddles, and had sat upon something which\"was not a cat--my first seat was--I so far recovered my sight, as to\"perceive that Mr. Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the\"family; that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the\"two sisters; and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the\"conference, inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand--so familiar as\"it looked to me, and yet so odd!--and was referring to it through an\"eye-glass. They were dressed alike, but this sister wore her dress with\"a more youthful air than the other; and perhaps had a trifle more frill,\"or tucker, or brooch, or bracelet, or some little thing of that kind,\"which made her look more lively. They were both upright in their\"carriage, formal, precise, composed, and quiet. The sister who had\"not my letter, had her arms crossed on her breast, and resting on each\"other, like an Idol.\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield, I believe,\' said the sister who had got my letter,\"addressing herself to Traddles.\"\"This was a frightful beginning. Traddles had to indicate that I was Mr.\"Copperfield, and I had to lay claim to myself, and they had to divest\"themselves of a preconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield,\"and altogether we were in a nice condition.

My private opinion is, that this was entirely a gratuitous\"assumption, and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such\"sentiments--to which he had never given any sort of expression that\"I could ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had a\"superstition, however, that he would have declared his passion, if he\"had not been cut short in his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking\"his constitution, and over-doing an attempt to set it right again by\"swilling Bath water. They had a lurking suspicion even, that he died of\"secret love; though I must say there was a picture of him in the house\"with a damask nose, which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed\"upon.\"\"\'We will not,\' said Miss Lavinia, \'enter on the past history of this\"matter. Our poor brother Francis\'s death has cancelled that.\'\"\"\'We had not,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'been in the habit of frequent\"association with our brother Francis; but there was no decided division\"or disunion between us. Francis took his road; we took ours. We\"considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should\"be so. And it was so.\'\"\"Each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak, shook her head\"after speaking, and became upright again when silent. Miss Clarissa\"never moved her arms. She sometimes played tunes upon them with her\"fingers--minuets and marches I should think--but never moved them.\"\"\'Our niece\'s position, or supposed position, is much changed by our\"brother Francis\'s death,\' said Miss Lavinia; \'and therefore we consider\"our brother\'s opinions as regarded her position as being changed too. We\"have no reason to doubt, Mr. Copperfield, that you are a young gentleman\"possessed of good qualities and honourable character; or that you have\"an affection--or are fully persuaded that you have an affection--for our\"niece.\'\"\"I replied, as I usually did whenever I had a chance, that nobody had\"ever loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles came to my assistance\"with a confirmatory murmur.\"\"Miss Lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder, when Miss Clarissa,\"who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother\"Francis, struck in again:\"\"\'If Dora\'s mama,\' she said, \'when she married our brother Francis, had\"at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner-table,\"it would have been better for the happiness of all parties.\'\"\"\'Sister Clarissa,\' said Miss Lavinia. \'Perhaps we needn\'t mind that\"now.\'\"\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'it belongs to the subject. With\"your branch of the subject, on which alone you are competent to speak, I\"should not think of interfering. On this branch of the subject I have a\"voice and an opinion. It would have been better for the happiness of\"all parties, if Dora\'s mama, when she married our brother Francis, had\"mentioned plainly what her intentions were. We should then have known\"what we had to expect. We should have said \"Pray do not invite us,\"at any time\"; and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been\"avoided.\'\"\"When Miss Clarissa had shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed: again\"referring to my letter through her eye-glass. They both had little\"bright round twinkling eyes, by the way, which were like birds\' eyes.\"They were not unlike birds, altogether; having a sharp, brisk, sudden\"manner, and a little short, spruce way of adjusting themselves, like\"canaries.\"\"Miss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed:\"\"\'You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield,\"to visit here, as the accepted suitor of our niece.\'\"\"\'If our brother Francis,\' said Miss Clarissa, breaking out again, if I\"may call anything so calm a breaking out, \'wished to surround himself\"with an atmosphere of Doctors\' Commons, and of Doctors\' Commons only,\"what right or desire had we to object? None, I am sure. We have ever\"been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone. But why not say\"so? Let our brother Francis and his wife have their society. Let\"my sister Lavinia and myself have our society. We can find it for\"ourselves, I hope.\'\"\"As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me, both Traddles and\"I made some sort of reply. Traddles was inaudible. I think I observed,\"myself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned. I don\'t in the\"least know what I meant.\"\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, having now relieved her mind, \'you\"can go on, my dear.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia proceeded:\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful\"indeed in considering this letter; and we have not considered it without\"finally showing it to our niece, and discussing it with our niece. We\"have no doubt that you think you like her very much.\'\"\"\'Think, ma\'am,\' I rapturously began, \'oh!--\'\"\"But Miss Clarissa giving me a look (just like a sharp canary), as\"requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle, I begged pardon.\"\"\'Affection,\' said Miss Lavinia, glancing at her sister for\"corroboration, which she gave in the form of a little nod to every\"clause, \'mature affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express\"itself. Its voice is low. It is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush,\"waits and waits. Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away,\"and finds it still ripening in the shade.\'\"\"Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her\"supposed experience of the stricken Pidger; but I saw, from the gravity\"with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached\"to these words.\"\"\'The light--for I call them, in comparison with such sentiments, the\"light--inclinations of very young people,\' pursued Miss Lavinia, \'are\"dust, compared to rocks. It is owing to the difficulty of knowing\"whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation, that\"my sister Clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act, Mr.\"Copperfield, and Mr.--\'\"\"\'Traddles,\' said my friend, finding himself looked at.\"\"\'I beg pardon. Of the Inner Temple, I believe?\' said Miss Clarissa,\"again glancing at my letter.\"\"Traddles said \'Exactly so,\' and became pretty red in the face.\"\"Now, although I had not received any express encouragement as yet, I\"fancied that I saw in the two little sisters, and particularly in Miss\"Lavinia, an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of\"domestic interest, a settling down to make the most of it, a disposition\"to pet it, in which there was a good bright ray of hope. I thought\"I perceived that Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in\"superintending two young lovers, like Dora and me; and that Miss\"Clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend\"us, and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject\"whenever that impulse was strong upon her. This gave me courage to\"protest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell, or\"anyone believe; that all my friends knew how I loved her; that my aunt,\"Agnes, Traddles, everyone who knew me, knew how I loved her, and how\"earnest my love had made me.

They both had little\"bright round twinkling eyes, by the way, which were like birds\' eyes.\"They were not unlike birds, altogether; having a sharp, brisk, sudden\"manner, and a little short, spruce way of adjusting themselves, like\"canaries.\"\"Miss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed:\"\"\'You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield,\"to visit here, as the accepted suitor of our niece.\'\"\"\'If our brother Francis,\' said Miss Clarissa, breaking out again, if I\"may call anything so calm a breaking out, \'wished to surround himself\"with an atmosphere of Doctors\' Commons, and of Doctors\' Commons only,\"what right or desire had we to object? None, I am sure. We have ever\"been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone. But why not say\"so? Let our brother Francis and his wife have their society. Let\"my sister Lavinia and myself have our society. We can find it for\"ourselves, I hope.\'\"\"As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me, both Traddles and\"I made some sort of reply. Traddles was inaudible. I think I observed,\"myself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned. I don\'t in the\"least know what I meant.\"\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, having now relieved her mind, \'you\"can go on, my dear.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia proceeded:\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful\"indeed in considering this letter; and we have not considered it without\"finally showing it to our niece, and discussing it with our niece. We\"have no doubt that you think you like her very much.\'\"\"\'Think, ma\'am,\' I rapturously began, \'oh!--\'\"\"But Miss Clarissa giving me a look (just like a sharp canary), as\"requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle, I begged pardon.\"\"\'Affection,\' said Miss Lavinia, glancing at her sister for\"corroboration, which she gave in the form of a little nod to every\"clause, \'mature affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express\"itself. Its voice is low. It is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush,\"waits and waits. Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away,\"and finds it still ripening in the shade.\'\"\"Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her\"supposed experience of the stricken Pidger; but I saw, from the gravity\"with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached\"to these words.\"\"\'The light--for I call them, in comparison with such sentiments, the\"light--inclinations of very young people,\' pursued Miss Lavinia, \'are\"dust, compared to rocks. It is owing to the difficulty of knowing\"whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation, that\"my sister Clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act, Mr.\"Copperfield, and Mr.--\'\"\"\'Traddles,\' said my friend, finding himself looked at.\"\"\'I beg pardon. Of the Inner Temple, I believe?\' said Miss Clarissa,\"again glancing at my letter.\"\"Traddles said \'Exactly so,\' and became pretty red in the face.\"\"Now, although I had not received any express encouragement as yet, I\"fancied that I saw in the two little sisters, and particularly in Miss\"Lavinia, an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of\"domestic interest, a settling down to make the most of it, a disposition\"to pet it, in which there was a good bright ray of hope. I thought\"I perceived that Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in\"superintending two young lovers, like Dora and me; and that Miss\"Clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend\"us, and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject\"whenever that impulse was strong upon her. This gave me courage to\"protest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell, or\"anyone believe; that all my friends knew how I loved her; that my aunt,\"Agnes, Traddles, everyone who knew me, knew how I loved her, and how\"earnest my love had made me. For the truth of this, I appealed to\"Traddles. And Traddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a\"Parliamentary Debate, really did come out nobly: confirming me in good\"round terms, and in a plain sensible practical manner, that evidently\"made a favourable impression.\"\"\'I speak, if I may presume to say so, as one who has some little\"experience of such things,\' said Traddles, \'being myself engaged to a\"young lady--one of ten, down in Devonshire--and seeing no probability,\"at present, of our engagement coming to a termination.\'\"\"\'You may be able to confirm what I have said, Mr. Traddles,\' observed\"Miss Lavinia, evidently taking a new interest in him, \'of the affection\"that is modest and retiring; that waits and waits?\'\"\"\'Entirely, ma\'am,\' said Traddles.\"\"Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia, and shook her head gravely. Miss\"Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh.\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'take my smelling-bottle.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic\"vinegar--Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while; and\"then went on to say, rather faintly:\"\"\'My sister and myself have been in great doubt, Mr. Traddles, what\"course we ought to take in reference to the likings, or imaginary\"likings, of such very young people as your friend Mr. Copperfield and\"our niece.\'\"\"\'Our brother Francis\'s child,\' remarked Miss Clarissa. \'If our brother\"Francis\'s wife had found it convenient in her lifetime (though she had\"an unquestionable right to act as she thought best) to invite the family\"to her dinner-table, we might have known our brother Francis\'s child\"better at the present moment. Sister Lavinia, proceed.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia turned my letter, so as to bring the superscription towards\"herself, and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking\"notes she had made on that part of it.\"\"\'It seems to us,\' said she, \'prudent, Mr. Traddles, to bring these\"feelings to the test of our own observation. At present we know nothing\"of them, and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there\"may be in them. Therefore we are inclined so far to accede to Mr.\"Copperfield\'s proposal, as to admit his visits here.\'\"\"\'I shall never, dear ladies,\' I exclaimed, relieved of an immense load\"of apprehension, \'forget your kindness!\'\"\"\'But,\' pursued Miss Lavinia,--\'but, we would prefer to regard those\"visits, Mr. Traddles, as made, at present, to us. We must guard\"ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between Mr.\"Copperfield and our niece, until we have had an opportunity--\'\"\"\'Until YOU have had an opportunity, sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa.\"\"\'Be it so,\' assented Miss Lavinia, with a sigh--\'until I have had an\"opportunity of observing them.\'\"\"\'Copperfield,\' said Traddles, turning to me, \'you feel, I am sure, that\"nothing could be more reasonable or considerate.\'\"\"\'Nothing!\' cried I. \'I am deeply sensible of it.\'\"\"\'In this position of affairs,\' said Miss Lavinia, again referring to\"her notes, \'and admitting his visits on this understanding only, we\"must require from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assurance, on his word of\"honour, that no communication of any kind shall take place between him\"and our niece without our knowledge. That no project whatever shall be\"entertained with regard to our niece, without being first submitted to\"us--\' \'To you, sister Lavinia,\' Miss Clarissa interposed.\"\"\'Be it so, Clarissa!\' assented Miss Lavinia resignedly--\'to me--and\"receiving our concurrence. We must make this a most express and serious\"stipulation, not to be broken on any account. We wished Mr. Copperfield\"to be accompanied by some confidential friend today,\' with an\"inclination of her head towards Traddles, who bowed, \'in order that\"there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject. If Mr.\"Copperfield, or if you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving\"this promise, I beg you to take time to consider it.\'\"\"I exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervour, that not a moment\'s\"consideration could be necessary. I bound myself by the required\"promise, in a most impassioned manner; called upon Traddles to witness\"it; and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if I ever\"swerved from it in the least degree.\"\"\'Stay!\' said Miss Lavinia, ho see, Sophy being of so much use in the family, none of them could\"endure the thought of her ever being married. Indeed, they had quite\"settled among themselves that she never was to be married, and they\"called her the old maid. Accordingly, when I mentioned it, with the\"greatest precaution, to Mrs. Crewler--\'\"\"\'The mama?\' said I.\"\"\'The mama,\' said Traddles--\'Reverend Horace Crewler--when I mentioned it\"with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler, the effect upon her was\"such that she gave a scream and became insensible. I couldn\'t approach\"the subject again, for months.\'\"\"\'You did at last?\' said I.\"\"\'Well, the Reverend Horace did,\' said Traddles. \'He is an excellent man,\"most exemplary in every way; and he pointed out to her that she ought,\"as a Christian, to reconcile herself to the sacrifice (especially as it\"was so uncertain), and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me. As to\"myself, Copperfield, I give you my word, I felt a perfect bird of prey\"towards the family.\'\"\"\'The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?\'\"\"\'Why, I can\'t say they did,\' he returned. \'When we had comparatively\"reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You\"recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter\"with her spine?\'\"\"\'Perfectly!\'\"\"\'She clenched both her hands,\' said Traddles, looking at me in dismay;\"\'shut her eyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; and\"took nothing for two days but toast-and-water, administered with a\"tea-spoon.\'\"\"\'What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!\' I remarked.\"\"\'Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield!\' said Traddles. \'She is a very\"charming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling. In fact, they all\"have. Sophy told me afterwards, that the self-reproach she underwent\"while she was in attendance upon Sarah, no words could describe. I know\"it must have been severe, by my own feelings, Copperfield; which were\"like a criminal\'s. After Sarah was restored, we still had to break it\"to the other eight; and it produced various effects upon them of a most\"pathetic nature. The two little ones, whom Sophy educates, have only\"just left off de-testing me.\'\"\"\'At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?\' said I.\"\"\'Ye-yes, I should say they were, on the whole, resigned to it,\' said\"Traddles, doubtfully. \'The fact is, we avoid mentioning the subject;\"and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great\"consolation to them. There will be a deplorable scene, whenever we\"are married. It will be much more like a funeral, than a wedding. And\"they\'ll all hate me for taking her away!\'\"\"His honest face, as he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his\"head, impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality,\"for I was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation\"and wandering of mind, as to be quite unable to fix my attention on\"anything. On our approaching the house where the Misses Spenlow lived,\"I was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of\"mind, that Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass\"of ale. This having been administered at a neighbouring public-house, he\"conducted me, with tottering steps, to the Misses Spenlow\'s door.\"\"I had a vague sensation of being, as it were, on view, when the maid\"opened it; and of wavering, somehow, across a hall with a weather-glass\"in it, into a quiet little drawing-room on the ground-floor, commanding\"a neat garden. Also of sitting down here, on a sofa, and seeing\"Traddles\'s hair start up, now his hat was removed, like one of those\"obtrusive little figures made of springs, that fly out of fictitious\"snuff-boxes when the lid is taken off. Also of hearing an old-fashioned\"clock ticking away on the chimney-piece, and trying to make it keep time\"to the jerking of my heart,--which it wouldn\'t. Also of looking round\"the room for any sign of Dora, and seeing none. Also of thinking that\"Jip once barked in the distance, and was instantly choked by somebody.\"Ultimately I found myself backing Traddles into the fireplace, and\"bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies, dressed in\"black, and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of\"the late Mr. Spenlow.\"\"\'Pray,\' said one of the two little ladies, \'be seated.\'\"\"When I had done tumbling over Traddles, and had sat upon something which\"was not a cat--my first seat was--I so far recovered my sight, as to\"perceive that Mr. Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the\"family; that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the\"two sisters; and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the\"conference, inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand--so familiar as\"it looked to me, and yet so odd!--and was referring to it through an\"eye-glass. They were dressed alike, but this sister wore her dress with\"a more youthful air than the other; and perhaps had a trifle more frill,\"or tucker, or brooch, or bracelet, or some little thing of that kind,\"which made her look more lively. They were both upright in their\"carriage, formal, precise, composed, and quiet. The sister who had\"not my letter, had her arms crossed on her breast, and resting on each\"other, like an Idol.\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield, I believe,\' said the sister who had got my letter,\"addressing herself to Traddles.\"\"This was a frightful beginning. Traddles had to indicate that I was Mr.\"Copperfield, and I had to lay claim to myself, and they had to divest\"themselves of a preconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield,\"and altogether we were in a nice condition. To improve it, we all\"distinctly heard Jip give two short barks, and receive another choke.\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield!\' said the sister with the letter.\"\"I did something--bowed, I suppose--and was all attention, when the other\"sister struck in.\"\"\'My sister Lavinia,\' said she \'being conversant with matters of this\"nature, will state what we consider most calculated to promote the\"happiness of both parties.\'\"\"I discovered afterwards that Miss Lavinia was an authority in affairs\"of the heart, by reason of there having anciently existed a certain Mr.\"Pidger, who played short whist, and was supposed to have been enamoured\"of her. My private opinion is, that this was entirely a gratuitous\"assumption, and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such\"sentiments--to which he had never given any sort of expression that\"I could ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had a\"superstition, however, that he would have declared his passion, if he\"had not been cut short in his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking\"his constitution, and over-doing an attempt to set it right again by\"swilling Bath water. They had a lurking suspicion even, that he died of\"secret love; though I must say there was a picture of him in the house\"with a damask nose, which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed\"upon.\"\"\'We will not,\' said Miss Lavinia, \'enter on the past history of this\"matter. Our poor brother Francis\'s death has cancelled that.\'\"\"\'We had not,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'been in the habit of frequent\"association with our brother Francis; but there was no decided division\"or disunion between us. Francis took his road; we took ours. We\"considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should\"be so. And it was so.\'\"\"Each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak, shook her head\"after speaking, and became upright again when silent. Miss Clarissa\"never moved her arms. She sometimes played tunes upon them with her\"fingers--minuets and marches I should think--but never moved them.\"\"\'Our niece\'s position, or supposed position, is much changed by our\"brother Francis\'s death,\' said Miss Lavinia; \'and therefore we consider\"our brother\'s opinions as regarded her position as being changed too. We\"have no reason to doubt, Mr. Copperfield, that you are a young gentleman\"possessed of good qualities and honourable character; or that you have\"an affection--or are fully persuaded that you have an affection--for our\"niece.\'\"\"I replied, as I usually did whenever I had a chance, that nobody had\"ever loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles came to my assistance\"with a confirmatory murmur.\"\"Miss Lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder, when Miss Clarissa,\"who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother\"Francis, struck in again:\"\"\'If Dora\'s mama,\' she said, \'when she married our brother Francis, had\"at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner-table,\"it would have been better for the happiness of all parties.\'\"\"\'Sister Clarissa,\' said Miss Lavinia. \'Perhaps we needn\'t mind that\"now.\'\"\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, \'it belongs to the subject. With\"your branch of the subject, on which alone you are competent to speak, I\"should not think of interfering. On this branch of the subject I have a\"voice and an opinion. It would have been better for the happiness of\"all parties, if Dora\'s mama, when she married our brother Francis, had\"mentioned plainly what her intentions were. We should then have known\"what we had to expect. We should have said \"Pray do not invite us,\"at any time\"; and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been\"avoided.\'\"\"When Miss Clarissa had shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed: again\"referring to my letter through her eye-glass. They both had little\"bright round twinkling eyes, by the way, which were like birds\' eyes.\"They were not unlike birds, altogether; having a sharp, brisk, sudden\"manner, and a little short, spruce way of adjusting themselves, like\"canaries.\"\"Miss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed:\"\"\'You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield,\"to visit here, as the accepted suitor of our niece.\'\"\"\'If our brother Francis,\' said Miss Clarissa, breaking out again, if I\"may call anything so calm a breaking out, \'wished to surround himself\"with an atmosphere of Doctors\' Commons, and of Doctors\' Commons only,\"what right or desire had we to object? None, I am sure. We have ever\"been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone. But why not say\"so? Let our brother Francis and his wife have their society. Let\"my sister Lavinia and myself have our society. We can find it for\"ourselves, I hope.\'\"\"As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me, both Traddles and\"I made some sort of reply. Traddles was inaudible. I think I observed,\"myself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned. I don\'t in the\"least know what I meant.\"\"\'Sister Lavinia,\' said Miss Clarissa, having now relieved her mind, \'you\"can go on, my dear.\'\"\"Miss Lavinia proceeded:\"\"\'Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful\"indeed in considering this letter; and we have not considered it without\"finally showing it to our niece, and discussing it with our niece. We\"have no doubt that you think you like her very much.\'\"\"\'Think, ma\'am,\' I rapturously began, \'oh!--\'\"\"But Miss Clarissa giving me a look (just like a sharp canary), as\"requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle, I begged pardon.\"\"\'Affection,\' said Miss Lavinia, glancing at her sister for\"corroboration, which she gave in the form of a little nod to every\"clause, \'mature affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express\"itself. Its voice is low. It is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush,\"waits and waits. Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away,\"and finds it still ripening in the shade.\'\"\"Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her\"supposed experience of the stricken Pidger; but I saw, from the gravity\"with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached\"to these words.\"\"\'The light--for I call them, in comparison with such sentiments, the\"light--inclinations of very young people,\' pursued Miss Lavinia, \'are\"dust, compared to rocks.
